# In this day and age, our tech overlords are putting the final nail in the coffin for offline HTML games.
# At the time I'm writing these lines, Firefox, and probably Chromium soon, completely forbids a local HTML game from keeping any kind of memory.
# If you want to be able to save your progress, you will need to play the game with your own local web server. In python, it's done with:

python -m http.server

# You'll find online-hosted versions of the game on
# https://www.yo252yo.com
# or
# https://yo252yo.itch.io
# that should retain your progress unless more changes have been made by the People Who Decide to break my games.
# It seems to me a bit of a harsh punishment to completely kill offline HTML games just because a couple of people don't know how to use a computer.
# But hey, this is the world we live in.
# Cheers.
