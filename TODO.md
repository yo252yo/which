# IDEATION

- why am i me and not him
- which one am i

- people come and go: why am i now instead of some other time? Why is it now rather than any time?

- crowd movement (small bird flock mechanism): who do i follow
- then you find yourself inlfuencing people: where does me stop (mb towards ending?)
Why am I one thing instead of many? Mb in gameplay you draw a boundary 
special level where you control people in the shape of a body?? or mb its the end, you start to lose your mind

========= MORE GOES HERE

- mb "why is there something rather than nothing" is the ending???

- dissolution of the ego. my I is the same as everybody else
- then fade to black after
- cyclical but this time the player has color options for the player, and mb a color picker?

first read= its obvious, second read = its so arbitrary
========
* Morality. Why is something right instead of wrong
Mb a trolley problem where inaction saves? Or a fps section with a gun and you have to shoot someone
* Why this emotion/color rather than another
* How do I know what I know, how do I know what I'm feeling, how do i know what to be
* Why this interpretation instead of another? Mb a play on the coma placement 
* Like why do I like this instead of something else? The gameplay is you pick something in a crowd of color bubbles mb 

========

Is it the same as why is there something rather than nothing? It's all about the arbitrariness of a single point.

The lone arbiter? The arbiter? The observer

find yourself?
which is i

quel est je

And everything was moving
