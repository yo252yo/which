#HACK ==================================================================
 I need a second type of entity, to represent object. Mb just emoji. And everyone would be interested in one in particular.

Mb click at the right time, when the object is close by 

It's a packman collecting mechanism. Pacman 

 Emoji flag, emoji leisure 


  Does it end by "you can't fill your hole? 
  Car tu peux pas tout contenir car tes fronti√®res sont poreuses et tu finit par te dissoudre 

  Every realisation made you feel more insignificant, more arbitrary. Your borders were porous 

  Makes you feel like a tiny dot on a vast tapestry of all other experiences to experience? 

  Stripped of all you "have" you're down to what you "are" the I, and it's shared by everyonr


Everyone gets a dot, zoom in, fade to black

 Big crowd at the end after pacman sequence, lower the size of silhouettes 

 Et de plus en plus rapide 


#HACK ==================================================================

# IDEATION

- why am i me and not him
- which one am i

- people come and go: why am i now instead of some other time? Why is it now rather than any time?

- crowd movement (small bird flock mechanism): who do i follow
- then you find yourself inlfuencing people: where does me stop (mb towards ending?)
Why am I one thing instead of many? Mb in gameplay you draw a boundary 
special level where you control people in the shape of a body?? or mb its the end, you start to lose your mind

========= MORE GOES HERE

- mb "why is there something rather than nothing" is the ending???

- dissolution of the ego. my I is the same as everybody else
- then fade to black after
- cyclical but this time the player has color options for the player, and mb a color picker?

first read= its obvious, second read = its so arbitrary
========
* Morality. Why is something right instead of wrong
Mb a trolley problem where inaction saves? Or a fps section with a gun and you have to shoot someone
* Why this emotion/color rather than another
* How do I know what I know, how do I know what I'm feeling, how do i know what to be
* Why this interpretation instead of another? Mb a play on the coma placement 
* Like why do I like this instead of something else? The gameplay is you pick something in a crowd of color bubbles mb 

========

Is it the same as why is there something rather than nothing? It's all about the arbitrariness of a single point.

The lone arbiter? The arbiter? The observer

find yourself?
which is i

quel est je

touch your self to progress

Mb transition : in fact the world was more full than you ever imaginer

And everything was moving 

you need to stand out to be noticed

gameplay milestones:
- introduce decoy (more and more)
- introduce motion 
- remove random spawn
