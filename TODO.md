# SPRITE WORK
* proper sprite
* thicker outline

# OTHER
* write first draft
* sfx, vfx
* jump to page
* better index apples, or skip apples sometimes (mb some levels only the player can eat???)
* new game + color picker


# PAGES
- crowd movement (small bird flock mechanism): who do i follow
- then you find yourself inlfuencing people: where does me stop (mb towards ending?) special level where you control people in the shape of a body?? or mb its the end, you start to lose your mind
Why am I one thing instead of many? Mb in gameplay you draw a boundary 

why is there something rather than nothing?

# ENDING
Does it end by "you can't fill your hole? Car tu peux pas tout contenir car tes frontiÃ¨res sont poreuses et tu finit par te dissoudre 
Big crowd at the end after pacman sequence, lower the size of silhouettes, Everyone gets a dot, zoom in, fade to black
Every realisation made you feel more insignificant, more arbitrary. Your borders were porous 
Makes you feel like a tiny dot on a vast tapestry of all other experiences to experience? 
Stripped of all you "have" you're down to what you "are" the I, and it's shared by everyonr
mb it ends as you consuming everyone's experiences until you grow too big?
celebrer payer attention aux autres mb ??
dissolution of the ego. my I is the same as everybody else
then fade to black after

>> traditional representation embrace death as a part of life, id rather transcend it as nonsensical to begin with, but then what constructs the continuity of self well nothing its an illusion so ofc its brittle but also that means its fluid it can reshape and when you die when this game ends  the next game just takes nother form youknow but equating it iin a loop is a bit misdirecting because that hints that the next existence is on the same level as the one before and they are different phases but in fact i wanna put the stress on the CONTINUITY along every dimension both in space but most importantly in time, 
the core of this prject is that your thick lines are absurd, things are continuous, so obviously in space within the game but also and mb more importantly in time


# GAMEPLAY IDEAS
Mb click at the right time, when the object is close by 
Match someone's movement? Adopt an other rpov 


# MISC NOTES
* you need to stand out to be noticed
* touch your self to progress
* first read should be "its obvious", second read = "its so arbitrary"
