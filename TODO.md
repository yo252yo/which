* sfx on found, mb vfx too?

* End gameplay is : catch a fast dot

* rewrite the ending:
New gameplay : paint everyone the same color while trying to find the boundaries of your interaction
p26/27/28
You noticed that everything was affected by the ramifications of your actions. You began to reconsider the boundary between what you can influence and not
Something about there being a multitude in you?

I dont like p30, 
There wasnt a part of this fabric that you didnt influence or get influenced by


p24-25 are redundant

27 ok <painting game prompt?>
28 ok <painting game prompt?>
<< space for painting game
29 << should either be in previous gameplay phase or in next gameplay phase but the "seen from far enough" is the queue for final sequence


# GAMEPLAY
Should I have a level select page with this chaptering?
P1-10 : Birth
p11-16: Childhood - hidden object variations (colors, numbers)
P17-22: Teenagehood - Pacman
P23-28: Adulthood - crowd coloring
P29-33: Enlightenement - catch


# SPRITE WORK
* proper sprite
* thicker outline

# GAMEPLAY IDEAS
Mb click at the right time, when the object is close by 
Match someone's movement? Adopt an other rpov 


# MISC NOTES
* you need to stand out to be noticed
* touch your self to progress
* first read should be "its obvious", second read = "its so arbitrary"
* "you can't fill your hole? Car tu peux pas tout contenir car tes frontiÃ¨res sont poreuses et tu finit par te dissoudre
